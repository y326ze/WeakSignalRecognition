# Weak Signal Recognition Using BERT and DGCN: An AI Application Study in Finance

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in finance, the identification of weak signals has become increasingly critical for forecasting future trends and mitigating potential risks. This paper introduces a novel weak signal recognition framework that integrates BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and DGCN (Directed Graph Convolutional Network). The framework leverages deep semantic understanding of text and knowledge network topology through topic modeling, enhanced by topic and term filtering, to extract weak signals from relevant domains.
Using academic literature on AI in finance from 2018 to 2024 as the primary data source, the study achieves precise identification of emerging research topics by constructing a citation network and applying a directed graph convolutional network alongside BERT-based text vectorization. Potential weak-signal topics are further refined using weak function filtering, while representative terms are selected based on c-TF-IDF (class-based Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and citation analysis. The results demonstrate that 57% of the early-detected weak signals evolved into significant industry trends, validating the efficacy of the proposed methodology. Based on the weak signals identified in 2024, the paper forecasts three pivotal future directions for AI in finance: the emergence of green fintech, transformative breakthroughs in financial inclusion, and deeper collaboration between fintech and government entities.
This research not only advances the technical framework for weak signal detection but also offers strategic insights for financial institutions in technology deployment, investment decisions, and risk management. Additionally, it provides regulators and policymakers with a robust monitoring tool to track technological developments. By integrating multidisciplinary approaches, the study enhances strategic decision-making in uncertain environments and contributes new perspectives for the sustainable growth of financial technology.The findings underscore the frameworkâ€™s accuracy and foresight in identifying nascent technological trends, effectively capturing weak signals within the fintech domain to deliver actionable intelligence. 
Future research will focus on expanding data sources by developing heterogeneous datasets that incorporate multilingual sources, non-English literature, patents, and industry reports to capture a more comprehensive spectrum of weak signals. Model optimization will explore lightweight architectures and distributed training frameworks to improve computational efficiency and real-time processing capabilities. Application diversification will extend weak signal recognition to other high-risk, dynamic fields while developing visualization tools to help decision-makers better understand term correlations and evolutionary patterns.Furthermore, ethical and societal implications will be carefully considered, with the development of compliance frameworks to ensure adherence to data privacy and intellectual property standards while fostering innovation. Through these advancements, weak signal recognition technology is poised to play a transformative role across diverse sectors, offering robust support for strategic decision-making in an increasingly complex world.
